web application to manage traveler issue from

health. It mainly aims to model the nursing practice and the

associated XSLT transformations. The data for this project is

stored, read, written and transformed in an XML format (cabinet.xml

/patient.xml). As well as a practice and patient model in

XMLSchema, a cabinet instance in XML (cabinet.xsd and

patient.xsd) then XSLT transformations aimed at extracting

patient data, the list of interventions by a nurse and the invoice

of a patient.
